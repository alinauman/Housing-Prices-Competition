# Housing-Prices-Competition
This is a perfect competition for data science students who have completed an online course in machine learning and are looking to 
expand their skill set before trying a featured competition.The idea is to create and submit predictions for a Kaggle competition.

- Build a Random Forest model with all of your data (X and y)
- Read in the "test" data, which doesn't include values for the target. Predict home values in the test data with your Random Forest model.
- Submit those predictions to the competition and see your score.

The submission file is also part of this repository, indicating the scores that were being achieved as well.
